				off and landing, with the student following \
				along on the controls. At the end of the flight \
				there will be a debriefing to go over the flight \
				and to plan for your next lesson. Allow \
				about one and a half hours. The cost is $99 \
				and includes your first logbook."

	question = "WHAT DO I NEED TO START FLYING LESSONS?"
	answer = "We supply the airplane and headset. You’ll \
				need to be comfortably and appropriately \

				are a nice accessory on sunny days, but not \
				required."


    # FAQ
	[[params.questions.list]]
	question = "HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GET A PRIVATE PILOT CERTIFICATE?"
    answer = "The FAA requires a minimum of 40 hours of \
				instruction and experience for a private pilot \
				certificate. Most pilots require 60 or more \
				flight hours to prepare them for their practical \
				test. A lesson usually includes one hour of \
				flying. We recommend 3 to 4 lessons a \
				week, but some students pace it at one or \
				two lessons a month."

    # FAQ
	[[params.questions.list]]
	question = "WHEN DO I GET TO FLY BY MYSELF?"
 	answer = "This will happen after both you and your \
				instructor feel you are ready. The FAA \
				requires you to have passed your flight \
				physical, be 16 years of age, and your \
				instructor has signed an endorsement in \
				your logbook that you are ready. That first \
				flight alone is referred to as your “Solo” and \
				generally happens after 12 to 20 hours of \
				instruction."


    # FAQ
	[[params.questions.list]]
	question = "SHOULD I TAKE GROUND SCHOOL BEFORE I START FLYING?"
    answer = "There is no need for any bookwork before \
				you take your first flight. There is some \
				studying involved in flying, to learn the \
				regulations and the inner workings of an \
				airplane, but that can be done as you work \
				on developing your flying skills. The FAA \
				has a required written test, but it’s multiple \
				choice and they tell you the questions and \
				possible answers beforehand, so don’t \
				sweat it. There are a lot of study aids, \
				videos and classes available to help you \
				learn the material. We can help you find one \
				that works for your learning style."


    # FAQ
	[[params.questions.list]]
	question = "WHAT CAN I DO WITH A PRIVATE PILOT CERTIFICATE?"
    answer = "We make our aircraft available for rent to \
				licensed pilots for anything from a quick flight \
				along the coast to a month long trip to \
				explore the west. There are thousands of \
				public airports in the United States hoping \
				you’ll stop by."


 	# FAQ
	[[params.questions.list]]
	question = "WHAT TYPE OF AIRCRAFT WILL I BE FLYING?"
    answer = "Most of our students start their lessons in \
				one of our Cessna 172’s. These high wing \
				four seat aluminum airplanes are known as \
				“Skyhawks”. They are comfortable, \
				predictable and very well built, making them \
				one of the most popular – and safe – training \
				aircraft ever built. \
				Some pilots really love to fly tailwheel \
				airplanes and for them we have a Citabria. \
				Ours was built in 2004, though the design \
				dates back to Grandpa’s time. It is truly \
				“stick and rudder” flying, with fantastic \
				visibility."


    # FAQ
	[[params.questions.list]]
	question = "WHAT HAPPENS IF THE WEATHER IS BAD?"
    answer = "We want flight training to be safe AND fun. It \
				isn’t safe if thunderstorms are in the area or \
				the clouds are low. It isn’t fun if it is really \
				windy or turbulent or cold. Book your lesson \
				when you can and if the weather is outside \
				your comfort zone (or ours), we’ll just cancel \
				the lesson and fly on another day."
